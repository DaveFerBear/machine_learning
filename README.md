### Language Detection
Scripts to aggregate and format lists of English, French, and random words.  This is part of a larger machine learning project to detect the language of a new string given a training set.  Amazon Machine Learning and the AWS Prediction API were used.

### Number Classification
Image classification of MNIST dataset (handwritten numbers).  The processed dataset can be found [here](http://cis.jhu.edu/~sachin/digit/digit.html).  This classic ML problem is part of a tensorflow tutorial, however I deviated from it significantly.
