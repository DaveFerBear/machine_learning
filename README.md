### Circle Detection
Testing various CNN architectures to detect grayscale circles in images with varying degrees of noise. Both DIOU (Distance-IoU) and MSE (Mean square error) loss are used.

### Fruit Classification
Kaggle [Fuits-360 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits/version/9), containing 60 fruit classes and ~30k images. The CNN implemented has three convolutional layers, trains on a CPU in <30 minutes, and achieves 92% accuracy on this task.

### Language Detection
Scripts to aggregate and format lists of English, French, and random words.  This is part of a larger machine learning project to detect the language of a new string given a training set.  Amazon Machine Learning and the AWS Prediction API were used.

### Number Classification
Image classification of MNIST dataset (handwritten numbers).  The processed dataset can be found [here](http://cis.jhu.edu/~sachin/digit/digit.html).  This classic ML problem is part of a tensorflow tutorial, howevever my implementation deviates significantly.  I achieve 94% accuracy.
